<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>I use the following chat services (in order of personal preference):</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal</li>
<li>Matrix</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bitcoin">Bitcoin</h2>
<p>You know what Bitcoin is, <a href="https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4">but how does it work?</a>. 3blue1brown (Grant Sanderson) on Youtube explains it best.
How secure is Bitcoin? <a href="https://youtu.be/S9JGmA5_unY">A numerical explanation</a>, again by 3blue1brown (Grant Sanderson) on Youtube.</p>
<h2 id="services-and-hardware">Services and Hardware</h2>
<p>I self-host a good number of services on my inexpensive private cluster of ARM single-board computers (SBCs) and a x86 NUC.</p>
<p><img src="../images/cloud.jpg" alt="Cloud Setup"></p>
<p>My cluster machine composition is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-xu4/odroid-xu4">Odroid XU4</a> (armv7l running ArchlinuxARM)</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-n2/odroid-n2">Odroid N2</a> (aarch64 running Ubuntu)</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.kobol.io/helios64/intro/">Kobol Helios64</a> (aarch64 running Armbian)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/au/Mini-PcBarebone/GB-BRR5H-4500-rev-10">Gigabyte Brix S NUC</a> (x86_64 running Archlinux)</li>
</ul>
<p>My setup involves setting Docker Swarm and each service is then spun up using a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, therefore all my services are Linux distribution-agnostic.
Unfortunately, I need to stick with specific distributions for specific hardware due to poor/slow kernel maintainenance by the hardware vendors.
For storage, I have disk drives physically mounted in one of my nodes and I share the NAS using NFS with LAN.
All my devices operate within the docker swarm network which is encrypted within my LAN and the only ingress/egress network interfaces are an exposed HTTPS port and wireguard UDP port whitelisted on my router.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://superloop.com.au">Superloop</a> as my ISP.
They have relatively good and reliable international transit compared to other past ISPs I have used (i.e. TPG, Tangerine, AussieBB and Exetel).</p>
<p>Since June 2020, I have ceased paying for any online services besides virtual private server hosting.</p>
<p>Some example services that I self-host:</p>
<ul>
<li>MTA (<a href="https://internet.nl/mail/renlord.com/359119/">internel.nl results</a>)</li>
<li>Bitcoin w. Lightning</li>
<li>IRC bouncer</li>
<li>Nextcloud</li>
<li>Jellyfin</li>
<li>HomeAssistant</li>
<li>and more&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="melbourne-cycling">Melbourne Cycling</h2>
<p>Since public transport is highly unreliable and road congestion drives me crazy, I ride a bicycle around Melbourne.</p>
<p><img src="../images/bicycle.jpg" alt="Reid Vantage Endurance 2.0"></p>
<p>** THIS BICYCLE WAS STOLEN IN DECEMBER 2020!! **</p>
<p>Thief came into bike garage with an angle grinder and cut the lock. Stolen in Melbourne CBD.</p>
<p><img src="../images/reacto-6000.jpg" alt="Merida Reacto 6000 Disc 2021"></p>
<p>Merida Reacto 6000 Disc 2021</p>
<p>My upgraded bicycle since March 2021. I now keep my bicycle with me personally, at all times.
Bicycle locks aren&rsquo;t really effective in Melbourne since angle grinders can be purchased for cheap from Bunnings.</p>

Use browser-zoom to view map in detail.</p>
<p>Riding on the road around Melbourne is also pretty good. There are some excellent dedicated pop-up cycling lanes such as the recent <a href="https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/traffic-and-road-use/cycling/pop-up-bike-lanes">Heidelberg Pop-up Bike Lanes</a> that connect Collingwood/Fitzroy all the way through to Heidelberg or the Chandler Highway/Heidelberg Road intersection.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Heidelberg-Rd-Link.JPG" alt="Heidelberg Road Link">
Heidelberg Road Link</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of signage along the Heidelberg Road Link both inbound/outbound from Collingwood. It is easy to follow the signs and the road condition along this particular road link is excellent. Cyclist now travelling across the Heidelberg Road bridge have a wide dedicated lane, so there&rsquo;s no need to be concerned of side-swipes from cars.</p>

<p>Last Updated: 01.10.2021</p>
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>I use the following chat services (in order of personal preference):</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal</li>
<li>Whatsapp (Inevitable in SG)</li>
<li>Matrix</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bitcoin">Bitcoin</h2>
<p>You know what Bitcoin is, <a href="https://youtu.be/bBC-nXj3Ng4">but how does it work?</a>. 3blue1brown (Grant Sanderson) on Youtube explains it best.
How secure is Bitcoin? <a href="https://youtu.be/S9JGmA5_unY">A numerical explanation</a>, again by 3blue1brown (Grant Sanderson) on Youtube.</p>
<h2 id="services-and-hardware">Services and Hardware</h2>
<p>I self-host a good number of services on my inexpensive private cluster of ARM single-board computers (SBCs) and a x86 NUC.</p>
<p><img src="../images/cloud.jpg" alt="Cloud Setup"></p>
<p>My cluster machine composition is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-xu4/odroid-xu4">Odroid XU4</a> (armv7l running ArchlinuxARM) &mdash; DEPRECATED</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-n2/odroid-n2">Odroid N2</a> (aarch64 running Ubuntu)</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.kobol.io/helios64/intro/">Kobol Helios64</a> (aarch64 running Armbian)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/au/Mini-PcBarebone/GB-BRR5H-4500-rev-10">Gigabyte Brix S NUC</a> (x86_64 running Archlinux)</li>
</ul>
<p>My setup involves setting Docker Swarm and each service is then spun up using a
<code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, therefore all my services are Linux
distribution-agnostic.
Unfortunately, I need to stick with specific distributions for specific
hardware due to poor/slow kernel maintainenance by the hardware vendors.
For storage, I have disk drives physically mounted in one of my nodes and I
share the NAS using NFS with LAN.
All my devices operate within the docker swarm network which is encrypted
within my LAN and the only ingress/egress network interfaces are an exposed
HTTPS port and wireguard UDP port whitelisted on my router.</p>
<p>Since June 2020, I have ceased paying for any online services besides virtual private server hosting.</p>
<p>Some example services that I self-host:</p>
<ul>
<li>MTA (<a href="https://internet.nl/mail/renlord.com/359119/">internel.nl results</a>)</li>
<li>Bitcoin w. Lightning</li>
<li>Nextcloud</li>
<li>Jellyfin</li>
<li>HomeAssistant</li>
<li>and more&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vps">VPS Providers</h2>
<p>I use OVH to host my MTA.</p>
<h2 id="isp">Internet Service Provider</h2>
<p>Now that I have moved to Singapore, I use <a href="https://viewqwest.com">Viewqwest</a>.
Their default plan puts customers behind a CGNAT, you need to pay $3/month
extra to get a static IPv4 address and they don&rsquo;t even give out free dynamic
IPv4 addresses.</p>
<p>When I was in Melbourne, I use <a href="https://superloop.com.au">Superloop</a> as my ISP.
They have relatively good and reliable international transit compared to other
past ISPs I have used (i.e. TPG, Tangerine, AussieBB and Exetel).</p>
<h2 id="sg-banking">Banking in SG</h2>
<p>Banking in SG is really tricky, the staff and procedures in place are
relentless with very little room for flexibility.
You need a local address for the purposes of opening a bank account, ask your
employer to help you with proof of address, you definitely need it!</p>
<p>Out of all the banking apps, the one that works best without GPay/Apple Pay
dependency is UOB Mighty.
They actually bothered to implement contactless payment against the Android NFC API.
The other banks such as DBS/POSB, OCBC and friends just outsource to Apple Pay
and Google Pay.</p>
<h2 id="cycling">Cycling</h2>
<p><img src="../images/bicycle.jpg" alt="Reid Vantage Endurance 2.0"></p>
<p>** THIS BICYCLE WAS STOLEN IN DECEMBER 2020!! **</p>
<p>Thief came into bike garage with an angle grinder and cut the lock. Stolen in Melbourne CBD.</p>
<p><img src="../images/reacto-6000.jpg" alt="Merida Reacto 6000 Disc 2021"></p>
<p>Merida Reacto 6000 Disc 2021</p>
<p>My upgraded bicycle since March 2021. I now keep my bicycle with me personally, at all times.
Bicycle locks aren&rsquo;t really effective in Melbourne since angle grinders can be purchased for cheap from Bunnings.</p>
<h3 id="cycling-sg">Singapore</h3>
<p>I only ride on roads in Singapore.
The speed limit on sidewalks and the park connector network is too slow.</p>
<h4 id="hazards">Hazards</h4>
<p>Cycling on the road in Singapore can be FUN and FAST but hazardous if you dont know what you are doing.</p>
<p>Below is a collection of road intersections that are particularly bad based on my cycling experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AVOID ALL VIADUCTS/FLYOVERS</strong>.
No clearance on side for evasive manuveurs. Left turns often result in crashing into concrete barriers and a guaranteed trip to the hospital.</li>
<li>Northbound Upper Serangoon Road/Serangoon Central (where NEX shopping mall is).
Without fail, car drivers (especially Taxi drivers) often merge left <strong>late</strong> to turn into Serangoon Central and <strong>do not</strong> bother with a fucking head check or turning on their left indicator and expect users with right of way to yield.</li>
<li>Southbound Upper Serangoon Road/PIE/Macpherson Road/Bendemeer Road Roundabout.
Car drivers do not obey lane markings when entering roundabout or turn into the wrong lane.
Expect to yield to stupid drivers.</li>
<li>Eastbound Nicole Highway
Very wide road, relatively uncongested most of the time so vehicles often travel very fast.</li>
<li>East/West-bound Braddell Road. <strong>DO NOT ATTEMPT</strong>
Use of flyover is unavoidable at some sections and its design almost resembles an expressway, very unsafe for cyclist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, relatively road bike friendly roads for <strong>fast</strong> commuting (faster than Bus/MRT) in SG have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 ~ 3 lane wide. 3 lane wide roads should have a dedicated bus lane.</li>
<li>Does not have have on/off-ramp to expressways.</li>
<li>With speed limit of less than 60kph.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downtown -&gt; Punggol &ndash; Serangoon Road (except the roundabout that connects to PIE)/Upper Serangoon Road</li>
<li>Punggol -&gt; Downtown &ndash; Upp. Serangoon Road/Serangoon Road/Bendemeer Road/Jalan Besar/Victoria St</li>
<li>Downtown -&gt; Changi &ndash; Victoria St/Kallang Road/Sims Ave/Upp. Changi Road/Xilin Ave./Tanah Merah Coastal Road</li>
</ul>
<p>Some tips when cycling in SG roads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not tail bus. Always overtake when possible.</li>
<li>Always indicate and perform head checks.</li>
<li>Try to maintain pace above 30~40kph. Drivers usually yield and provide pretty good spacing if you can maintain good pacing.</li>
<li>Turn right using <a href="https://youtu.be/rUuYWyoI0zQ">hook turns</a>. Much safer than negotiating a lane change across a 3+ lane wide road.</li>
</ul>

Use browser-zoom to view map in detail.</p>
<p>Riding on the road around Melbourne is also pretty good. There are some excellent dedicated pop-up cycling lanes such as the recent <a href="https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/traffic-and-road-use/cycling/pop-up-bike-lanes">Heidelberg Pop-up Bike Lanes</a> that connect Collingwood/Fitzroy all the way through to Heidelberg or the Chandler Highway/Heidelberg Road intersection.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Heidelberg-Rd-Link.JPG" alt="Heidelberg Road Link">
Heidelberg Road Link</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of signage along the Heidelberg Road Link both inbound/outbound from Collingwood. It is easy to follow the signs and the road condition along this particular road link is excellent. Cyclist now travelling across the Heidelberg Road bridge have a wide dedicated lane, so there&rsquo;s no need to be concerned of side-swipes from cars.</p>

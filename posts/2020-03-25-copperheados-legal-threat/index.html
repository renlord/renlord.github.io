<main>
<p>A few months ago I received legal threats from CopperheadOS alledging that I have infringed their copyright when I&rsquo;ve personally made contributions to the Graphene OS project.
These accusations are <strong>invalid</strong> and have no legal basis whatsoever as the copyright of the cited code belongs to Daniel Micay who is the project owner of Graphene OS.</p>
<p>I have released these legal letters (sent to both <a href="../../letters/my-bogus-legal.pdf">myself personally</a> and <a href="../../letters/uni-bogus-legal.pdf">my academic institution</a>, The University of Melbourne) in the public domain.
As to the accusation of my usage of University resources and breach of the <a href="https://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1314">Acceptable IT Policy</a>, this is completely <strong>unfounded</strong> and <strong>untrue</strong>.
My contributions to Graphene OS are authored on my personal devices, in fact I was on leave of absence during the alledged contribution period.
All of these can be verified against university records.</p>
<p>My hope is that the open source community and interested third parties will call out this toxic behaviour and ask that Copperhead OS cease their invalid actions immediately.</p>

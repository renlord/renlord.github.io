      <description>This is a blog post (part 1) describing my hellish experience as a renter in Singapore. If you&amp;rsquo;re a prospective renter looking to rent in Singapore, I hope this post helps with your tenancy experience.
I started my lease in Stars of Kovan, a short 300m walk away from Kovan MRT Station which is served by the Purple line. Its immediate vicinity is surrounded by eateries and a very busy thoroughfare - Upper Serangoon Road.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently just set up an IPv6-only AS called Zippy Kangaroo.
I broadcast my IPv6 prefixes from my home server cluster. So far, only supporting ICMP.
Hoping to run more services.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking for fellow ASes to peer with!</description>

      <title>Forwarding DNS queries over TLS on Tor</title>
      <link>https://renlord.com/posts/2021-09-26-dns-over-tls-over-tor/</link>

      <description>DNS query metadata can leak a lot of information about your internet activities. While DNS-over-TLS/HTTPS has definitely improved DNS privacy over the years, DNS requests can still be associated with user identity at the resolver by logging the origin IP address of the DNS query request. DNS-over-TLS-over-Tor addresses this vulnerability as Tor circuits masquerade the origin of the DNS request.
Cloudflare deployed its DNS resolver as a Tor Hidden Service back in 2018.</description>

      <title>CopperheadOS Bogus Legal Threat</title>

      <description>A few months ago I received legal threats from CopperheadOS alledging that I have infringed their copyright when I&amp;rsquo;ve personally made contributions to the Graphene OS project. These accusations are invalid and have no legal basis whatsoever as the copyright of the cited code belongs to Daniel Micay who is the project owner of Graphene OS.
I have released these legal letters (sent to both myself personally and my academic institution, The University of Melbourne) in the public domain.</description>

      <title>Docker Multiarch Builds Quick and Easy</title>
      <link>https://renlord.com/posts/2019-11-09-docker-multiarch/</link>

      <description>As you all known from my things page, I run a multiarch cluster of nodes to run a variety of my services. More often than not, service images provided by maintainers only support x86 and x86_64 architectures. As a consequence of this, I have to self-build my service images.
When it was just building for one type of architecture (i.e. arm32) for my Odroid XU4, it was not so bad. Once I added another node, my arm64 Odroid-N2, it started to become a hassle to manually author custom Dockerfiles to build for each architecture by hand.</description>

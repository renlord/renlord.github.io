      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently just set up an IPv6-only AS called Zippy Kangaroo.
I broadcast my IPv6 prefixes from my home server cluster. So far, only supporting ICMP.
Hoping to run more services.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking for fellow ASes to peer with!</description>

      <title>Forwarding DNS queries over TLS on Tor</title>

      <description>DNS query metadata can leak a lot of information about your internet activities. While DNS-over-TLS/HTTPS has definitely improved DNS privacy over the years, DNS requests can still be associated with user identity at the resolver by logging the origin IP address of the DNS query request. DNS-over-TLS-over-Tor addresses this vulnerability as Tor circuits masquerade the origin of the DNS request.
Cloudflare deployed its DNS resolver as a Tor Hidden Service back in 2018.</description>

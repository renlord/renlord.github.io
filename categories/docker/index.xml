      <description>As you all known from my things page, I run a multiarch cluster of nodes to run a variety of my services. More often than not, service images provided by maintainers only support x86 and x86_64 architectures. As a consequence of this, I have to self-build my service images.
When it was just building for one type of architecture (i.e. arm32) for my Odroid XU4, it was not so bad.</description>

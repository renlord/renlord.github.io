      <title>Self Hosting a Mail Transfer Agent</title>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, Daniel from Graphene OS suggested to me that I should just self-host my own emails as many email providers do not properly setup the latest security extensions that help realise better security for email. To that end, I have decided to also self-host my own MTA &amp;ndash; which now runs as katmail.xyz.
Email hosting is akin to setting up a virtual post-office, responsible for managing all electronic mail leaving and arriving for a set of mdomains handled by the delegated Mail Transfer Agent.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I received legal threats from CopperheadOS alledging that I have infringed their copyright when I&amp;rsquo;ve personally made contributions to the Graphene OS project. These accusations are invalid and have no legal basis whatsoever as the copyright of the cited code belongs to Daniel Micay who is the project owner of Graphene OS.
I have released these legal letters (sent to both myself personally and my academic institution, The University of Melbourne) in the public domain.</description>

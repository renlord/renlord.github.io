      <description>This is a blog post (part 1) describing my hellish experience as a renter in Singapore. If you&amp;rsquo;re a prospective renter looking to rent in Singapore, I hope this post helps with your tenancy experience.
I started my lease in Stars of Kovan, a short 300m walk away from Kovan MRT Station which is served by the Purple line. Its immediate vicinity is surrounded by eateries and a very busy thoroughfare - Upper Serangoon Road.</description>
